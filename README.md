# Final Project-Team 7
### Abstract: 
For our final project, we will be creating a turn-based role-playing game similar to early era computer games by using the Nexys A7-100T and the Diligent Pmod OLED. In this game, the player will challenge three enemies using a set of four options for attacks. For this game we will be using the Audio I/O core to generate background music/sound effects and the SPI core to show the current enemy name and current health of the player on the Pmod OLED. As for the controls, the player will be using a mouse to control the game by using the right mouse button to switch between choices and then use the left mouse button to confirm their choice. For the VGA output, we will use moving sprites for enemies when they are either waiting for the player or taking damage. We will also be using on-screen text to display player options, attack descriptions, and an enemyâ€™s name and health.
